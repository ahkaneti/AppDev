# AppDev
This is Tagalonghome (working name) with purple and blue colors LOL

## Structure of the app
- App.js is wrapped in a React-Native app container in index
- The app is separated into screens which will be located in `./Loc/app/screens`
- images will be in `./Loc/app/images`
- components will be in `./Loc/app/components`
- any config files will be in `./Loc/app/config`

## Setting up the app
1. Navigate to Loc
2. `$ npm install`
3. `$ react-native run-ios`
   - If there are multiple xcode projects you will have to manually run the app in Xcode

## Style guide (internal)
- No style guide right now, please just document your code
